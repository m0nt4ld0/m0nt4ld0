# Hello World ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Mariela Montaldo, and I am passionate about technology and literature.

From a very young age, I knew my work would be connected to technology. My childhood games revolved around dressing up as a <i>"computer scientist"</i> and dismantling the cabinet of my <i>[Intel i386 with 16 MB of RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386)</i>, as well as every electronic device that came into my hands. All of this was fueled by an endless curiosity to understand how computers worked, which made me never want to take my fingers off the keyboard. Without realizing it, I had already decided to let that passion guide me.

During my teenage years, those childhood dreams began to take shape in projects, and I taught myself web development (which eventually led to developing my schoolâ€™s website).

After finishing high school, I worked for two years as a freelance developer, focusing on <b>PHP and the Symfony Framework</b>.

Eventually, I dove into the world of <b>Business Intelligence and Business Analytics</b>.

Today, I am eager to return to my roots and continue developing applications (both Web and Mobile). As a result, I am furthering my education in Java (Full Stack) and other tools, which I describe below. At the same time, I enjoy creatively connecting different areas of knowledge. For this reason, I would like to complement my technical background with the journey I am pursuing in Psychology. I enjoy working in teams, especially interdisciplinary teams that foster creative thinking.

## Currently

- ðŸ”­ I work as a <b>Web Developer</b> at Provincia Seguros S.A., where I also worked as a <b>BI & BA Sr. Analyst</b> for four years and served as a <b>Project Leader</b> for the <b>Smart Contracts project</b> for another two years.
- ðŸŒ± I am taking my first steps as a <b>Java Full Stack Developer</b>. Additionally, I am pursuing a degree in <b>Psychology</b> ([UAI](https://uai.edu.ar/facultades/psicolog%C3%ADa-y-relaciones-humanas/licenciatura-en-psicolog%C3%ADa/)).
- ðŸ‘¯ In programming, Iâ€™d like to collaborate on projects where I can apply and grow my skills in the various languages I work with. Regarding psychology, Iâ€™d like to participate in a research project where I can integrate programming knowledge and skills into areas of interest such as Social Psychology, behavior, and neurodivergence.
- ðŸ’¬ I can assist with topics related to <b>Business Intelligence & Business Analytics</b>, particularly MS SQL Server, IBM DataStage, MicroStrategy, and Cognos Analytics. I also have two years of experience with <b>PHP and Symfony Framework</b>.

## My GitHub Account
My repositories contain both current and older code since I am uploading solutions to exercises from previous years as well as other projects I have already completed. This means some repositories will have a current date but actually belong to earlier years (like timus-oj, which includes programming exercises I coded in C++ back in 2016 or even earlier).
